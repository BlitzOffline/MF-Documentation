# Introduction

![Matt&apos;s Framework \(MF\)](.gitbook/assets/mfthread.png)

**MF** used to be just a command framework for Spigot plugins based on [ACF](https://github.com/aikar/commands/), since then it has been expanded to have a GUI lib and more to come soon.  


### Libs

* [**MF**](mf/mf-1/) - _Command framework_
* \*\*\*\*[**MF-GUI**](mf-gui/gui/) - _GUI library_

### **Features** <a id="why-mf"></a>

* Simplifies how you handle your command arguments, instead of having an array with arguments and handling it one by one, simply add what you want to the parameters of your command method.
* Small, adds only 34KB to your project.
* All messages are customizable.
* Makes having multiple commands even easier.
* Custom tab completion handler.
* No need to register commands on your `plugin.yml`.
